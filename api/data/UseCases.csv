"","Ready Integration Testing Assistant","The Integration Consultant's Guide for UKG Ready Integration Testing","- Allow an IC to upload a workbook and output file. Compare the requirements with the results and share feedback. This is a proactive measure.
- Allow an IC to upload testing feedback from a carrier, which often comes in via email or a file (pdf, excel), and the test file that was sent. This is a reactive measure to help the IC move forward on a project.
- Based on the context shared above and an agent's knowledge of the Ready product and the context for the carrier, share the recommended next steps. The agent should be able to identify what is commonly a data issue vs. configuration issue vs. integration logic issue and try to guide the user in the right direction.","While testing integrations between UKG and third parties, there is often a lot of back-and-forth in the workflow:

- Send a test file
- Carrier reviews and shares feedback
- UKG reviews feedback, which could be related to data, configuration, and/or integration logic. Feedback is shared with the appropriate party to resolve, or internally resolved.
- Return to the start of this loop.

This can take many weeks or months for one project. Some carriers take weeks to reply, even if it turns out to be a small issue like an incorrect value in a header record, and the file could not be loaded. Clearly this can severely delay a project timeline.

We would save a lot of time with tools that support ICs during testing","This could reduce the timeline on integration projects by a number of weeks in many cases. Testing EDI is the most sensitive part of a project, as any small mistakes or key items missed during internal testing can lead to an extended timeline for customer/external testing (2+ weeks). A tool that can proactively test a file and align it with the requirements would add immense value to our ICs. The reactive testing would also help ICs digest feedback throughout testing, which will save at least an hour of testing time per project.

This idea can be used across all platforms, but it is important for an agent like this to have a degree of product knowledge catered to a given product, and understand carrier context to be successful.","Intelligent Document Processing,Information Retrieval,Document Summarization,Conversational AI","Spencer Williams","Customer Success & Services","Idea","Not Started","No Vendor Identified","No Product Identified","","12/16/2025 4:49 PM","Spencer Williams","Not a Priority","CX","","507","12/16/2025 4:49 PM","svcSharepointOnlinePS","False","True","Owner"

The agent will guide consultants through their assessment in a prescriptive way:

- IC uploads documents
- Agent assesses the details and identifies which integrations are needed
- Agent recommends key questions for the IC to ask on each integration
- IC shares the answers to each question, per integration
- Agent generates a requirements document based on these details, for each integration","We have many integration tech stacks across UKG Ready, with hundreds+ of varying endpoints to send/receive data to/from.

"","Automated Monitoring & Reporting of D365 Integration Data Management Batch Jobs","AI-driven automation to monitor D365 Data Management batch jobs and send daily email reports with job status, failures, resolutions, and key execution details—eliminating manual checks and improving integration reliability.","Currently, monitoring integration batch jobs in D365 is a manual, time-consuming, error-prone process. Each day, teams must:
Navigate to D365 Data Management job history, Review all Oracle → D365 sales order integrations (PSA, NA, ADP, etc.), Review Salesforce → D365 customer integrations, Identify failures or partial successes, Troubleshoot errors and document resolutions, Compile and send a status email to multiple stakeholders

This activity can consume significant analyst time and may lead to delayed detection, missed failures, or inconsistent reporting.

There is a strong opportunity to leverage an AI agent to automatically extract job status, failures messages, and email stakeholders daily creating a consistent, scalable, and real-time monitoring mechanism so that IT can look into email and action on errored jobs.","Daily manual checks are required to validate whether hundreds of batch jobs have succeeded or failed.

Integration failures have downstream business impact—delayed sales order creation, customer master issues, or operational bottlenecks.

Current manual reporting is highly dependent on individual team members and lacks standardization.

AI agents in D365 can automatically read Data Management job history logs, detect job state changes, and trigger communication workflows.","1. Operational Efficiency - Eliminates manual daily review of batch jobs.
Saves analyst time (estimated 1–2 hours/day), enabling reallocation to higher-value tasks.

2. Improved Integration Reliability - Ensures failures are detected immediately rather than waiting for manual review.

•	Automatically generate standardized, complete, and accurate requirements
•	Identify risks early in the process
•	Produce step-by-step CPQ configuration instructions
•	Generate documentation for commercialization and enablement
•	Scale dynamically as the product pipeline grows

The AI system acts as a digital product analyst, business analyst, CPQ architect, and documentation specialist—combined in one workflow.
","UKG’s strategic plan is to continuously launch new products and offerings to drive revenue growth, expand market share, and strengthen readiness for a future public offering. However, the current commercialization process is under significant strain. With a large pipeline of multiple products, compressed timelines, increasingly complex business and pricing models, and the need for tight end-to-end collaboration across Product, Pricing, Legal, Apps, GTM, and Enablement, launching new offerings has become operationally challenging.

These issues cascade into heavy pressure on the Apps team, who must configure, validate, and deploy products quickly despite incomplete information, multiple dependencies, and evolving business rules. As a result, UKG is increasingly at risk of missing EA/GA timelines.

To address this, we propose an AI-powered New Product Introduction system (APICS) that uses AI as the entry point for all new offerings. By ingesting product metadata, constraints, pricing models, and pre-conditions, the system will automatically:
•	Generate complete, standardized requirements
•	Identify risks, gaps, and cross-product dependencies
•	Produce step-by-step CPQ configuration instructions
•	Create documentation necessary for GTM

"","AI-Driven Duplicate Workflow Detection and Smart Search","AI-powered system to prevent duplicate workflows and enable smart, intuitive workflow discovery.","AI is used to automatically detect duplicate or similar workflows and enable intelligent, natural-language search, helping employees quickly find and reuse existing workflows.
1) Current Process-
Any employee can create a workflow.Once created, the workflow can be:
a)Added to the R+ Library Workflow
b)Shared with others from the Library
c)There is no control or intelligence around:Detecting whether a similar workflow already exists in the Library,
Preventing users from creating and saving near-duplicate workflows.
1.1) Problems with the Current Process:-
a)Duplicate workflows
b)Different users may create very similar workflows and save them with different names.
c)This leads to multiple versions of essentially the same process.
1.2) Heavy / cluttered Library
a)The Library gradually becomes large and difficult to navigate.
b)Performance and usability may be impacted as the Library grows.
1.3) Inefficient search & reuse
a)Employees may not easily find workflows they created earlier.
b)Employees may not find existing workflows relevant to their need, and end up recreating them from scratch.
2. Proposed Enhancement Using AI
Introduce an AI-powered workflow assistant integrated with the R Plus Library to:
a)Identify similar workflows at the time of saving
b)Provide intelligent search across workflows in the Library
2.1) AI Similarity Check (Duplicate Prevention)
When a user attempts to save a new workflow to the Library:
a)The AI engine compares the new workflow against existing workflows in the Library (based on:
Steps
Purpose / description
Metadata like title, tags, etc.)
b)The system then:
Suggests similar or duplicate workflows already present in the Library.
Displays a list of “Potentially similar workflows” with:
Workflow name
Owner / creator
Brief description
Last updated date
User options:
Reuse an existing workflow (as-is or by copying and modifying).
Continue saving the new workflow if it is genuinely different.
Benefits:
Reduces duplicate workflows with different names.
Keeps the Library lean and more maintainable.
Encourages reuse instead of re-creation.
2.2. AI-Powered Workflow Search Engine
Add a search feature in the Library with the following capabilities:
“My Workflows” search
Employees can quickly find workflows they have:
Created
Modified
Added to the Library
Filters: date, status, tags, usage frequency, etc.
Smart search by relatable / natural language terms
Employees can search for workflows using:
Business terms (e.g., “onboarding approval” , HR Actions, job requisitions etc)
Partial names or synonyms
Short descriptions of what they want to achieve
AI maps these queries to the most relevant workflows.
Recommendations
While a user types a query or starts creating a new workflow, the tool suggests:
“You might be looking for…” existing workflows
Popular or frequently used workflows for similar requests
Benefits:
Saves time by allowing users to quickly locate:
Workflows they created earlier
Existing workflows that match their current business need
Reduces the need to build new workflows for already-solved use cases.
Improves overall user experience and adoption of the Library.
3. Expected Outcomes
Reduced duplication of workflows in the R Plus Library
Improved Library performance and usability
Higher reuse rate of existing workflows
Time savings for employees when creating or searching for workflows
Cleaner governance over workflow assets

","1.Growing number of duplicate workflows-Multiple employees currently create workflows for similar or identical processes.These duplicates are often named differently, making them difficult to identify manually.
Library bloat continues to increase as new versions are added without visibility into existing ones.

2. Lack of intelligent search leads to rework-Users struggle to find workflows they created earlier due to limited search options.Employees often recreate workflows simply because they cannot locate an existing one.

3. Significant time wasted in workflow recreation-Employees spend unnecessary time building workflows from scratch that already exist in the Library.This leads to inefficiency and inconsistent process standards across teams.

4. Library usability declines as content grows-With hundreds or thousands of workflows stored, manual review becomes impractical.Overloaded libraries reduce adoption and discourage reuse.

5. No existing mechanism to prevent duplication-The system does not alert users if a similar workflow already exists at the time of saving.Without AI comparison or similarity detection, duplication naturally increases over time.

6. Inconsistent naming & metadata challenges-Different users use different naming conventions, spellings, and descriptions.This makes exact-match search ineffective, increasing reliance on semantic (AI) search capabilities.

7. Increasing need for standardization and governance-Without AI support, maintaining workflow quality, reusability, and standardization becomes progressively harder.AI acts as a governance layer to keep the Library clean, optimized, and compliant with best practices.","1.Increased Efficiency & Time Savings-AI eliminates the need for employees to manually search through large libraries or rebuild workflows from scratch. By surfacing similar workflows instantly and enabling natural-language search, employees can complete tasks faster and focus on higher-value work.

2. Reduction in Duplicate Effort-AI-driven similarity detection prevents multiple users from creating identical workflows under different names. This reduces rework, minimizes redundancy, and ensures that only necessary and unique workflows are added to the Library.

3. Improved Workflow Quality & Consistency-By guiding users toward existing standardized workflows, AI promotes best practices and encourages consistent process design across the organization. This helps ensure high-quality, uniform workflows that follow organizational standards.

4. Enhanced User Experience-With intelligent search and personalized “My Workflows” access, employees can easily locate relevant workflows without guesswork or navigating an overloaded library. The result is a smoother, more intuitive user experience that drives higher adoption and satisfaction.

5. Optimized Library Management-AI helps maintain a cleaner, lighter, and more organized Library. Over time, this reduces management overhead, improves system performance, and ensures the Library remains a trusted repository of reusable workflows.

6. Better Governance & Compliance-By reducing uncontrolled duplication and improving visibility into existing workflows, the AI solution supports stronger governance. Teams can better track ownership, updates, and usage patterns, improving operational control and audit readiness.

7. Accelerated Decision-Making & Faster Request Fulfillment-With quick access to existing workflows and recommendations, teams can make faster decisions, respond to requests more quickly, and improve turnaround times for workflow-driven processes.","Information Retrieval,Natural Language Understanding (NLU)","Geetika Kohli","U Krewer,Product Management & Business Analysis","Idea","Not Started","No Vendor Identified","No Product Identified","","11/29/2025 2:08 AM","Geetika Kohli","Not a Priority","CX","","476","11/29/2025 2:09 AM","svcSharepointOnlinePS","False","False","Owner"

AI-assisted reclass journal automation","Use an AI agent to read RevPro usage invoice splits and automatically draft the matching reclass journal in D365 F&O, giving Finance a smart, review-ready entry that aligns with UKG’s AI strategy.","To use AI to automate the detective work and heavy lifting in the usage-to-revenue reconciliation process — turning a manual, error-prone GL reclass into an intelligent, system-generated recommendation that Finance simply reviews and posts.

What AI Is Being Used For

Reading the RevPro split logic
(product-level percentages, covered products, split amounts)

Understanding the original D365 posting
(summarized usage SKU, deferred revenue account, dimensions)

Calculating the exact reclass needed
(how to move deferred revenue between product dimensions so D365 matches RevPro)

Drafting the Journal Entry automatically

Debit/credit accounts

Product dimensions

Amounts

Correlation IDs

Explanation text for auditors

Presenting the JE to Finance for approval
(AI does the analysis, Finance stays in control)

Creating a repeatable, scalable reconciliation engine
that can be extended to other revenue and GL matching scenarios in the future.

AI gives us a smart reconciliation assistant — it reads the RevPro splits, figures out the reclass, and drafts the journal so Finance only has to review and post","1. ERP and RevPro operate at different granularity levels

D365 posts one summarized usage line using a shared SKU (USAGE-SW-MONTHLY).

RevPro splits that same invoice into multiple product-level lines using revenue allocation %.

This immediately causes differences in Deferred Revenue by product between systems.

2. Manual reconciliations are already happening

Finance is currently forced to run manual adjusting JEs to break out deferred revenue by product so it ties to RevPro.

These JEs are time-consuming, error-prone, unscalable, and introduce control risk.

3. Manual reclasses don’t trace back to the originating logic

Without automation, Finance has to re-calculate split amounts manually.

Hard for month-end approvers or auditors to validate whether the JE actually matches
RevPro logic.
→ AI can reliably follow the same logic every single time.

4. High volume makes manual work unsustainable

You have 20,000+ usage records per period — meaning 40,000+ reclass lines.

Finance cannot manually reconcile this with accuracy or speed.
→ Automation is the only realistic path at this scale.

5. No upstream fix exists

CPQ and D365 cannot be changed to hold product-level usage lines without redesigning Q2C and significantly increasing data volume.

RevPro must do the split — that’s the correct revenue accounting.
→ A downstream intelligent reconciliation layer is the only feasible solution.

6. SOX / audit expectations

Revenue is a key SOX control area.

Auditors expect:

Completeness and accuracy of system interfaces

Traceability for adjustments

Consistency in how revenue is recognized across systems
→ A system-generated, rule-derived JE is far more defensible than manual JEs.

7. Aligns with UKG’s AI strategy

UKG is driving AI adoption across teams.

Reconciliation automation is one of the safest, most impactful starting points:

Structured data

Clear logic

High volume

Low risk

Immediate ROI
→ This is an ideal AI pilot.

8. Creates a reusable capability

Once AI learns to reconcile usage billing, the same engine can be reused for:

Deferred → recognized revenue matching

FX variance explanations

Multi-entity eliminations

GL-subledger tie-outs
→ One investment → multiple future wins.

We need this because D365 and RevPro hold usage data at different levels of detail, and Finance is forced into high-volume manual reclasses; AI can automatically calculate the exact reclass that aligns ERP with RevPro, satisfies audit expectations, and removes a recurring operational burden.","Automating the usage reclass aligns revenue across systems, reduces manual effort, strengthens audit controls, accelerates close, and builds a reusable AI capability for UKG’s future Q2C transformation.

1. Accurate Revenue by Product

Aligning D365 and RevPro ensures usage revenue is reflected under the right product buckets (Pro, Central, Dimensions, Ready).
This improves margin analysis, product profitability reporting, and portfolio-level insights.

2. Reduced Manual Effort at Month-End

Today’s reconciliations require manual JE calculations, spreadsheets, and cross-system comparisons.
Automating the reclass removes a recurring operational burden and frees Finance to focus on analysis instead of clean-up.

3. Stronger Audit and SOX Compliance

System-generated reclass entries, backed by clear logic and correlation IDs, create a transparent audit trail and reduce control risk — especially around revenue, one of the highest-risk SOX areas.

4. Consistent, Repeatable Outcomes

Whether there are 20, 200, or 20,000 usage lines, automation ensures the same rules are applied every time with no human calculation errors or interpretation drift.

5. Faster, Cleaner Close

With the reconciliation heavy-lifting automated, UKG can shorten the month-end close cycle, reduce rework, and improve financial statement accuracy earlier in the process.

6. Scalable Foundation for Q2C Modernization (Nova)

Fixing reconciliation through automation creates a stable foundation for broader Q2C redesign.
It also prevents future technical debt by putting the detail in the right system and the intelligence in the right layer.

7. Upskilling & Innovation Opportunity

An AI-assisted reclass model is a safe, high-value pilot for Finance, Billing, and Integration teams.
It builds capabilities UKG can reuse across other reconciliation and automation opportunities.

"","Intelligent Non-PO Invoice Process in Exflow","Driving Scalable Efficiency through AI-Powered Smart Compliance in ExFlow","AI is being leveraged to transform UKG’s Non-PO invoice processing workflow in ExFlow into an intelligent, predictive, and scalable system. This initiative embeds automation and self-learning models into the Accounts Payable (AP) process to sustain UKG’s ~<2-day processing benchmark while strengthening accuracy, governance, and control.

Key AI applications include:

Automated Compliance Validation
AI dynamically validates invoices against the USD 5K PO threshold and exemption categories (Utilities, Insurance, etc.), automatically flagging potential policy breaches in real time.
This eliminates repetitive manual checks and ensures consistent, rule-based enforcement across regions.

Predictive GL Code & Cost Center Assignment
Machine-learning models trained on historical Non-PO invoices predict the most appropriate GL Codes and Cost Centers, displaying confidence scores for review.
The system continuously improves through feedback, achieving > 85 % accuracy over time and reducing manual coding effort by over 60 %.

Empowers Requestors via a Self-Service Chatbot
A conversational AI assistant integrated into ExFlow/MS Teams empowers requestors to self-resolve compliance and coding queries such as PO requirements, exemption logic, and GL Code selection.
This reduces back-and-forth clarifications, improves first-time-right submissions, and accelerates approval turnaround—enhancing both accuracy and user experience.

Strategic Impact
By embedding AI into compliance validation, coding prediction, and requestor support, UKG elevates ExFlow from a transactional platform to a decision-intelligent engine.
This automation reduces manual effort in compliance validation, improves accuracy to > 95 %, and sustains a ~<2-day AP processing benchmark as invoice volumes continue to grow across global entities.","The Non-PO invoice process within ExFlow operates efficiently today but still relies on significant compliance and coding validation effort for policy adherence and exception handling. Each Non-PO invoice undergoes checks against the USD 5K PO rule and exemption categories, followed by processor-led GL Code and Cost Center allocation. While effective, these human-led validation activities consume valuable processing time and limit scalability as invoice volumes continue to rise — driven by Immedis and other vendor additions.

Current operational realities include:

Compliance and Coding Validation Effort: Over 1,700 Non-PO invoices are processed monthly, each requiring detailed checks against the USD 5K rule and applicable exemptions, along with GL Code and Cost Center allocation. The cumulative effort grows as new entities are added.

Repetitive Processing Effort: Processors repeatedly validate and assign GL Codes and Cost Centers based on historical data, creating duplication that limits focus on exception resolution or higher-value analysis.

Dependency on AP Expertise: While SOPs guide the process and human judgment ensures accuracy, many validations still rely on repetitive interpretation and verification. This dependency makes the process effort-heavy and difficult to scale consistently as invoice volumes and regional variations increase.

Limited Real-Time Visibility: Compliance and coding validations remain reactive rather than predictive, restricting proactive exception management and operational agility.

Without AI-enabled intelligence, these validation efforts will continue to consume time, constrain agility, and limit visibility across an expanding global AP ecosystem.
Embedding AI into compliance validation, coding prediction, and requestor support directly addresses these friction points — reducing validation effort by over 60 %, improving compliance accuracy to > 95 %, and enabling UKG to sustain a ~<2-day processing benchmark as invoice volumes increase across global entities.","Implementing AI-powered smart compliance within ExFlow will unlock measurable operational efficiency, strengthen governance, and enhance scalability across our global Accounts Payable (AP) operations.

Quantifiable Benefits:

Productivity Uplift: Automation of compliance validation and coding activities is projected to reduce validation effort by over 60 %, freeing capacity for exception handling and analytical tasks.

Accuracy and Compliance Gains: Machine-learning models will improve coding and compliance accuracy to > 95 %, minimizing policy deviations and rework.

Sustained Throughput Performance: AI-enabled processing will allow AP to maintain a ~<2-day invoice cycle time even as volumes expand through new entities such as Immedis, ensuring timely payment cycles and strong vendor relationships.

Operational Efficiency: The reduction in repetitive validations and clarifications translates into measurable time savings and improved process economics, enabling higher throughput without additional resource investment.

Strategic and Qualitative Benefits:

Scalability and Standardization: AI introduces consistency within global AP operations by supporting processors in repetitive validations, promoting accuracy, and enabling standardized, data-driven decision-making across entities and regions.

Employee Empowerment: The self-service chatbot empowers requestors and processors to resolve compliance and coding queries independently, promoting autonomy and faster resolution times.

Governance and Risk Control: Embedded AI strengthens policy adherence and audit readiness through rule-based accuracy, automated traceability, and proactive compliance validation across finance operations.

Global Resilience and Operational Maturity: As our AP footprint expands across new entities, currencies, and regulatory environments, AI-driven compliance ensures that efficiency, governance, and accuracy scale in tandem.

Future-Ready AP Function: Beyond sustaining speed, this initiative reinforces consistency, compliance accuracy, and operational resilience — ensuring that the AP function continues to operate as a global benchmark for efficiency and governance.

Sustained Control Integrity: Ultimately, this initiative enables us to scale without complexity — preserving efficiency while strengthening financial control integrity and compliance across entities and regions.","Intelligent Document Processing,Predictive Modeling / Recommender,Machine Teaching / AutoML,Information Retrieval","Pankaj Jha","Business Operations, Delivery & Enablement,Privacy, Regulatory & Compliance","Idea","Help Needed","No Vendor Identified","No Product Identified","","11/13/2025 9:08 PM","Pankaj Jha","Not a Priority","Finance","Accounts Payable/Expense","448","12/16/2025 10:00 AM","Tilak Jaiswal","False","True",""

"","Credit & Concession Request Intake Form - Root Cause AI Assistant (V2)","Improve customer billing escalation process through proper routing","We recently went live with our new Credit & Concession Request (CCR) intake form in Salesforce. This form is used for teams across UKG to submit various types of customer billing escalations, inquiries, credit requests, contract change requests, and termination requests. The routing for these requests is based on the primary, secondary, and tertiary root causes selected by the requestor. A major pain point for the teams responsible for reviewing and responding to these requests is improper routing based on the root causes selected. The root cause options are not always the most intuitive and accuracy is highly dependent on the requestor's level of expertise. The majority of the time, routing should really be based on the type of fee involved in the request (i.e. PEPM subscription fee minimums or overages, Service Requests, Launch Fees, Forms & Print Services, Hardware, etc.), though there are some exceptions to this. We would see major improvements in efficiency and effectiveness if we could ensure requests are routed to the appropriate team upon submission, as opposed to sitting in one backlog just to be re-routed and sitting in another backlog. AI could be utilized to ask some clarifying questions of the user, potentially pull invoice line details to understand the type of fee associated with the request, and help guide the user on which root causes to select to ensure appropriate routing. Additionally, AI could help answering some of the more basic questions or guide the requestor on how they can find the answer themselves.

Today, customer requests come through AR representatives and are entered into a ServiceNow form, but there is no direct connection to the MDS master distribution list where the data is maintained. The process depends on manual monitoring, copy-and-paste updates, and dropdown selections.

AI could help by identifying more efficient ways to:

Streamline the flow of data from request to fulfillment.

Introduce automated validation or error detection for incomplete, duplicate, or invalid entries.

Provide greater visibility into existing customer setups and recipients.

Detect and manage termed customers to keep the distribution list current.","The current workflow is manual from end to end: customers email AR reps, AR reps enter data into ServiceNow, and the Finance fulfillment team re-enters that data into MDS.

Each month, roughly 20–25 requests are processed, each taking 2–5 minutes but requiring completion before the 4th of the month to avoid missed customer reports.

There are no system checks to prevent internal email addresses, duplicates, or inactive customers from remaining on the list.

Report selections are made manually through dropdowns, which is error-prone and inconsistent.

When a customer terms, there is no structured offboarding process; removal from MDS depends on ad-hoc AR submissions, resulting in outdated or non-compliant records.

"","NexusGPT","Your intelligent bridge across SharePoint, Dynamics, and Active Directory.","Create a single intelligent layer — NexusGPT — that connects SharePoint, Dynamics 365, and Active Directory to transform disconnected data into actionable procurement intelligence.

1. SharePoint → Knowledge Intelligence

Current Gap: Searching, reading, and comparing contracts and sourcing docs is slow and manual.
Opportunity: GPT delivers instant, plain-language insights from contracts, templates, and policies.
Value:

80–90% time saved on document retrieval and review

Improved compliance through consistent template use

2. Dynamics 365 → Data Intelligence

Current Gap: Users rely on analysts or reports to interpret spend, supplier, and renewal data.
Opportunity: GPT queries Dynamics data conversationally — “Show top 10 renewals by spend risk.”
Value:

90% reduction in manual reporting

Real-time, self-service analytics for non-technical users

3. Active Directory → Identity Intelligence

Current Gap: Role-based permissions and workflows require manual coordination and approvals.
Opportunity: GPT uses AD to personalize insights, enforce permissions, and auto-route actions.
Value:

Zero unauthorized access

Instant stakeholder routing, saving hours of email traffic

🚀 Combined Impact

NexusGPT = Intelligent Bridge Across Systems

Unified search and insight across structured (Dynamics) and unstructured (SharePoint) data

Personalized and secure access via AD

60–70% faster sourcing cycle time

Thousands of productivity hours reclaimed per year","1. Fragmented Procurement Ecosystem

Reality:
Procurement data lives in silos:

SharePoint holds thousands of RFPs, contracts, playbooks, and templates.

Dynamics 365 tracks suppliers, spend, renewals, and invoices.

Active Directory manages people, access, and approval chains.

Impact:

Users spend 25–40% of their time searching for information across these systems (Gartner, 2024).

Average procurement cycle time has grown by 20% since 2020 due to data fragmentation and manual coordination.

Critical insights (renewal dates, supplier risks, compliance issues) are missed because no system “talks” to the others.

2. Cognitive Overload and Manual Dependency

Evidence:
Procurement professionals spend:

~3 hours/week reviewing contracts they can’t easily summarize.

~2 hours/week chasing approvals or stakeholder info hidden in AD.

~1 hour/day toggling between SharePoint, Teams, and Dynamics to build a single renewal brief.

Business Cost:
For a 20-person sourcing team, that’s over 10,000 hours/year lost to administrative overhead — the equivalent of 5 full-time roles spent on non-value tasks.

3. Security and Governance Blind Spots

Evidence:

Without AD-linked permissions, shared drives and Power BI dashboards risk overexposing sensitive supplier or pricing data.

67% of organizations (Forrester, 2024) report shadow access incidents — employees unintentionally accessing restricted procurement docs.

Integrating GPT with AD ensures all AI insights stay permission-aware, reducing compliance and audit risks.

4. Limited Insight-to-Action Loop

Problem:
Copilot tools are limited to in-app productivity — they can summarize an email, but not connect it to a contract or renewal in Dynamics.
Result:
Teams get information faster, but not smarter. They still have to cross-reference multiple systems manually to act on it.

Opportunity:
NexusGPT breaks that wall by linking SharePoint + Dynamics + AD contextually:

“Show me all renewals over $1M, pull their contracts, summarize key risks, and alert the approver per AD hierarchy.”

Time saved: Hours → minutes
Decision quality: Improved through complete, cross-system visibility

5. Market Momentum & Strategic Timing

82% of enterprise procurement leaders plan to implement AI-enabled decision support by 2026 (Gartner Procurement Future Study, 2025).

Microsoft Copilot adoption focuses on productivity, but not procurement process intelligence — leaving a gap in the enterprise AI ecosystem.

UKG (and peers) are moving toward connected intelligence layers that unify their Microsoft stack — GPT integration is the logical next evolution.

💡 In Summary

Without NexusGPT:

Sourcing teams are buried in manual work and data silos.

Stakeholders waste time chasing information.

Compliance and visibility gaps persist.

With NexusGPT:

Systems speak the same language.

People act on insights, not spreadsheets.

Decisions are faster, data is secure, and procurement becomes predictive.","urning disconnected data into procurement intelligence.
🧭 1. Productivity & Time Savings

Problem: Manual searching, reporting, and approvals waste thousands of labor hours annually.
Value Delivered:

60–70% faster sourcing cycles through unified insights.

80–90% reduction in document retrieval time (SharePoint).

90% reduction in ad-hoc report creation time (Dynamics 365).

Full automation of role-based routing and approvals (Active Directory).

📈 Result: Each procurement professional gains 5–7 hours/week, equal to 1,000+ hours saved per year per team of 20 — equivalent to $150K–$250K in recovered productivity.

📊 2. Better, Faster Decision-Making

Problem: Key supplier and renewal decisions rely on fragmented or outdated data.
Value Delivered:

Instant access to cross-system insights — supplier performance, spend trends, and risk flags in one view.

Eliminates lag between data collection and analysis, enabling real-time decisioning.

Ensures that RFP vs. renewal choices are based on complete intelligence, not gut feel.

📈 Result: Smarter sourcing decisions improve negotiation leverage and reduce renewal overspend by 3–5%.

🧩 3. Governance, Compliance & Security

Problem: Without centralized controls, AI tools risk leaking sensitive data or bypassing approval hierarchies.
Value Delivered:

Active Directory integration ensures GPT respects permissions and roles automatically.

AI-driven document handling reduces exposure to shadow copies and outdated versions.

Provides audit-ready traceability — who accessed what, when, and why.

📈 Result: Strengthens procurement governance posture, reducing audit risk and data exposure incidents by up to 80%.

🏗️ 4. Enhanced Stakeholder Experience

Problem: Business partners wait on sourcing, finance, or IT for updates and visibility.
Value Delivered:

Natural language access to procurement insights — “What’s the renewal status of our AWS contract?”

Personalized responses using AD context — only shows relevant data for the requester’s role.

GPT-generated summaries and dashboards improve transparency and trust across departments.

📈 Result: Boosts stakeholder satisfaction and speeds collaboration — turning procurement into a strategic enabler instead of a bottleneck.

💰 5. Strategic ROI & Competitive Advantage

Value Delivered:

Drives measurable cost avoidance through proactive renewal and risk alerts.

Reduces dependency on external consultants and manual data prep.

Scales easily to other functions — Finance, Legal, IT — for compounding returns.

📈 Result:
A 3–5x ROI within 12–18 months, through a mix of productivity recovery, cost avoidance, and improved compliance efficiency.","Information Retrieval,Intelligent Document Processing,Conversational AI","Dani Van Camp","U Krewer","Idea","Not Started","Open AI","ChatGPT","https://chatgpt.com/g/g-68fa3fdb75848191b835d6028995f176-nexusgpt","10/23/2025 11:01 AM","Dani Van Camp","Not a Priority","Finance","Strategic Sourcing","416","11/19/2025 10:55 AM","Ross Sabath","False","False",""

"","Procurement Redlining Assistant","Performs redlining, clause analysis, and flags negotiation ","roblem to solve: Contract review/redlining is slow, inconsistent, and error-prone (version drift, undefined terms, broken cross-references), delaying deals and increasing risk.

Primary users: In-house legal, procurement, sales/RevOps, founders/ops at SMBs, and outside counsel needing quick turnarounds.

Jobs-to-be-done:

Compare two drafts and produce clean redlines;

Auto-categorize clauses and surface gaps;

Check defined-term consistency and cross-references;

Assess risk and flag negotiation items;

Generate executive/board-friendly summaries;

Adjust commentary by governing law (e.g., U.S., England & Wales).

Why this solution: Purpose-built outputs (markup [~del~]/[+add+], clause labels, risk notes, negotiation flags) map directly to legal workflows, unlike generic chat outputs.

Differentiators: Structured templates (Quick Summary, Detailed Comparison, Negotiation Notes, Executive Summary), neutrality (no legal advice), automatic party anonymization, jurisdiction-aware commentary.

Expected impact (hypotheses): Faster cycle time to signature, fewer escalations to senior counsel, higher consistency across drafts, clearer negotiation posture, and reduced oversight mistakes.","User/problem signals (qualitative):

Recurring needs to “compare two drafts,” “summarize key changes,” and “flag risky language.”

Pain around defined-term drift and numbering/cross-ref errors during late-stage edits.

Business stakeholders asking for plain-language summaries and negotiation talking points.

Solution fit (capability proof):

The assistant already delivers: version comparison with explicit add/delete markup; clause categorization; defined-term checks; risk assessment with ⚠️ Negotiation Needed; jurisdiction-aware notes; and confidentiality scrubbing to placeholders ([Party A], [Party B]).

Output templates align with how legal teams package deliverables (change logs, exec summaries, negotiation briefs).

Operational feasibility:

Deterministic, formatted outputs suitable for handoff to counsel or deal teams.

Works without external data connections; safe default stance (analytical, not legal advice).

Validation plan & metrics (to quantify impact):

Accuracy: Precision/recall on clause detection, defined-term consistency, cross-ref integrity vs. human baseline.

Efficiency: Time-on-task reduction for (a) first-pass redline, (b) risk triage, (c) executive summary creation.

Quality: Attorney review ratings (e.g., “usable as-is,” “minor edits,” “major edits”).

Business: Deal cycle time to signature, % drafts requiring outside counsel rework, user retention on repeat matters.","Faster deal cycles: Automates first-pass redlines, clause tagging, and summaries, shortening review loops and pulling revenue forward.

Lower legal cost per contract: Reduces in-house hours and outside-counsel spend by handling comparison, term checks, and drafting of exec/negotiation summaries.

Better risk posture at scale: Consistently flags high-risk language (⚠️ Negotiation Needed), undefined terms, and broken cross-references—fewer “leaks” into signed paper.

Higher consistency & quality: Standardized outputs (redlines, change logs, executive summaries) reduce variance between reviewers and minimize rework/escalations.

Scalable peak coverage: Absorbs end-of-quarter surges without adding headcount; repeatable deliverables for sales, procurement, and finance.

Knowledge capture: Encodes negotiation patterns and playbook-aligned suggestions; improves onboarding and continuity.

Quantified Impact (model)

Use these levers to estimate ROI; swap in your numbers.

Assumptions (example):

Contract volume: 600/year

Time saved per contract (first-pass + triage): 1.5–3.0 hrs

Blended legal cost/hour (in-house or external): $150–$300

Cost savings (time):
Annual Hours Saved = Volume × Hours Saved
Annual $ Saved = Annual Hours Saved × Blended Rate
→ With 600 × 2.0h × $200 = $240,000/year (illustrative).

Revenue acceleration (cycle time):
If average legal review drops 4 days, and ~20% of deals slip past quarter-end due to review, pulling even 10% of those into-quarter can materially improve bookings and cash. (Quantify with your ASP × #deals pulled in.)

Outside counsel avoidance:
If 15% of drafts currently go to outside counsel for basic redlining at ~2h each, shifting half to the assistant saves:
0.5 × 0.15 × Volume × 2h × $350 → For 600/year ≈ $31,500 (illustrative).

Rework/quality savings:
Fewer broken cross-refs/undefined terms reduces back-and-forth and re-signs; even 0.25h saved per contract at $200/h adds ≈ $30,000/year at 600/year.

Role-Specific Value

Sales/RevOps: Shorter “legal in review” stage; predictable redline turnaround; clearer negotiation talking points to unblock deals.

Legal: Focus shifts from mechanical comparison to strategic edits; fewer late-stage surprises; consistent jurisdiction-aware commentary.

Procurement: Faster vendor paper review; standardized risk flags for approvals; better audit readiness.

Finance/Execs: Pull-forward of revenue, reduced external spend, and clearer risk reporting via executive summaries.

Operational Advantages

Deterministic, handoff-ready outputs: Markup [~del~]/[+add+], clause labels, and change logs slot directly into existing workflows.

Governance & auditability: Automatic party anonymization and defined-term checks reduce confidentiality and compliance friction.

Low lift to adopt: Works on drafts you already have; no system integration required to start.

KPIs to Track

Cycle time: Draft-to-signature (and “legal in review” SLA).

Legal effort per contract (hours) and outside-counsel hours/cost.

% drafts with high-risk flags resolved pre-signature.

Redline accuracy vs. human baseline; rework rate.

Exec summary turnaround time; stakeholder satisfaction (CSAT).","Predictive Modeling / Recommender,Conversational AI,Intelligent Document Processing","Dani Van Camp","U Krewer","Diagnose","On-Track","Open AI","ChatGPT","https://chatgpt.com/g/g-68ee454408988191b07798fb20982a0e-redlining-assistant","10/14/2025 9:59 AM","Dani Van Camp","Not a Priority","Finance","Strategic Sourcing","404","11/19/2025 10:55 AM","Ross Sabath","False","False",""

Current Challenge

At present, the team manually reconciles multiple reports:

401K Export file (employee 401(k) contributions from payroll)

CYC CT Export file (health benefit accounts: HSAs, FSAs, HRAs)

Summary Payroll Register (SPR) Report

401K Loan Report

This reconciliation is performed twice (test and final), and the manual process takes ~20–25 minutes per run, with a high risk of oversight or calculation errors.

AI Idea

Leverage AI (ChatGPT or a similar LLM + automation) to:

Ingest multiple export files and reports (SPR, 401K Export, CYC CT Export, Loan Report).

Apply data transformation and validation rules (DTP rules) automatically.

Extract totals and perform variance checks between datasets.

Generate a standardized Excel output with two sheets:

Empower 401K reconciliation

CYC CT reconciliation
Each sheet highlights variances for quick review.

Benefits

Efficiency: Reduces reconciliation time from ~25 minutes to a few minutes.

Accuracy: Minimizes manual errors in comparing multiple complex datasets.

"","Auto Case Generation for Service Now","Reducing Manual Effort and Risk with Automated ServiceNow Requests","The idea is to leverage AI to automatically generate ServiceNow tickets for recurring requests such as FPS access, security group modifications, and elevated access. Instead of manually submitting these requests, AI would recognize the need, apply pre-defined parameters, and create the tickets instantly. This reduces repetitive manual effort, accelerates response times, and improves accuracy, allowing IT teams to focus on higher-value work while ensuring consistent handling of common access and security requests.","During critical periods such as year-end, the print shop must onboard and later offboard approximately 125 temporary employees. Each onboarding requires multiple repetitive ServiceNow tickets: four separate FPS access requests, additional security group modifications, and print shop access permissions. This creates hundreds of nearly identical tickets in a short timeframe, placing a heavy manual burden on IT staff. Automating this process with AI would eliminate repetitive work, ensure accuracy in access provisioning, and significantly reduce turnaround time, which is especially valuable during peak seasonal demand.","AI-driven ticket automation will significantly reduce the manual effort of creating repetitive ServiceNow requests. Currently, onboarding one employee requires multiple tickets and can take 10–20 minutes per employee to complete. At peak times, such as year-end when 125 employees are onboarded, this equates to 20–40+ hours of manual work spent solely on ticket creation. Automating this process will:

Save time and resources by eliminating repetitive manual entry.

Increase accuracy and consistency in access requests, reducing the risk of errors or missed steps.

Accelerate onboarding and offboarding timelines, ensuring employees are productive faster and compliance requirements are met.

Today, AR specialists spend significant time toggling between D365 and Outlook to retrieve balances, review communications history, and draft follow-up messages. This repetitive, manual work is time-consuming and often delays collections. With Copilot, collections staff would see real-time account summaries, outstanding balances, and prior interactions surfaced directly in Outlook, alongside AI-generated, tailored draft emails with recommended next steps. This approach allows finance staff to complete collections activities in the same tool where customer communication already occurs, eliminating inefficient system switching and reducing cycle times.","Collections processes are one of the most resource-intensive areas of finance operations, and specialists often spend up to 30% of their day gathering data and manually crafting outreach. Microsoft has already demonstrated in pilots that embedding collections data in Outlook can meaningfully reduce average handling time per account and accelerate days sales outstanding (DSO). For UKG, where AR teams manage thousands of accounts each month, even a modest efficiency gain has measurable impact. If Copilot reduces handling time by 20–30% as seen in other organizations, an AR specialist currently spending 20 hours a week on manual follow-up could save 4–6 hours. Scaled across a team of 20 specialists, this equates to more than 100 hours saved weekly, or over 5,000 hours annually. That capacity can either reduce cost or be redirected toward more strategic collections strategies, such as targeted outreach to high-risk accounts.","The anticipated business value extends beyond time savings. Faster and more consistent collections activity has a direct cash flow impact by shortening DSO, ensuring UKG receives payments sooner and improves working capital. AI also improves accuracy and compliance by standardizing outreach, ensuring communications are audit-ready, and reducing the risk of errors or inconsistent tone across customer messages. Finally, embedding collections automation directly in Outlook enhances the employee experience by allowing specialists to work more seamlessly in the tools they already use every day.

"","Penalty & Interest Calculation for SUI Cases","Penalty & Interest calculation for SUI cases, specifically for states where we do not have access to a portal","When SUI (State Unemployment Insurance) notices are not resolved within the specified timeframe, agencies impose penalties and interest. If such notices remain unreviewed, we must contact the agency—via phone or email—to obtain the updated balance due. This process is time-consuming and often leads to additional penalties and interest due to delays in follow-up
Proposed Solution
To address this challenge, I propose the implementation of a Penalty & Interest Calculator tailored to each SUI agency. This tool would:
•	Use agency-specific interest rates and penalty structures
•	Estimate balance due based on notice date and resolution delay
•	Reduce reliance on agency communication
•	Enable faster and more accurate case resolution
I have already developed a working calculator for MO LOCAL (W10 & P10). The tool is ready for testing to measure its accuracy and effectiveness in real-case scenarios.
Benefits
1.	Reduced Dependency on Agencies
•	Eliminates delays caused by waiting for agency responses
•	Enables internal estimation of dues
2.	Faster Case Resolution
•	Immediate access to estimated penalties and interest
•	Helps reduce backlog and improves turnaround time
3.	Cost Savings
•	Minimizes additional penalties and interest due to delayed follow-up
•	Reduces manual effort and time spent on agency communication
4.	Improved Accuracy and Compliance
•	Ensures consistent calculations based on agency rules
•	Enhances audit readiness and reduces risk of errors
5.	Scalability Across States
•	Once validated, the model can be replicated for other states
•	Creates a standardized toolset for the team
6.	Enhanced Team Productivity
•	Frees up time for analysts to focus on complex cases
•	Reduces workload and improves efficiency
7.	Better Stakeholder Communication
•	Provides quick and clear estimates for internal and client reporting
•	Builds trust through proactive case management
Next Steps
1.	Test the MO LOCAL calculator to validate accuracy and usability
2.	Expand the model to other states with similar SUI structures
3.	Coordinate with agencies to validate calculations and seek feedback
4.	Implement the tool across relevant teams to improve resolution efficiency
","The need for a Penalty & Interest Calculator arises from several recurring operational challenges observed during the handling of SUI notices:
1. Delays in Agency Response
Agencies often take time to respond to balance due inquiries, especially during peak periods.
These delays result in extended resolution timelines and increase the risk of accruing additional penalties and interest.
2. Manual Follow-Up Burden
Analysts spend significant time manually following up with agencies via calls and emails.
This effort could be redirected to resolving more complex cases if a reliable internal tool is available.
3. Financial Impact
In many cases, penalties and interest continue to accumulate while waiting for agency confirmation.
Having an internal calculator allows us to act faster, reducing the financial impact on clients and the company.
4. Case Backlog
The dependency on agency responses contributes to backlog growth.
A calculator enables quicker estimation and resolution, helping reduce the volume of pending cases.
5. Inconsistent Estimations
Without a standardized tool, estimations vary across analysts, leading to inconsistencies and potential errors.
A calculator ensures uniformity and accuracy in penalty and interest calculations.
6. Proof of Concept Already Developed
A working model for MO LOCAL (W10 & P10) has already been created and is ready for testing.
This provides a foundation to measure effectiveness and validate the need for broader implementation.
","The implementation of a Penalty & Interest Calculator for SUI notices offers several strategic and operational benefits to UKG:
1. Operational Efficiency
Reduces time spent on manual follow-ups with agencies.
Enables faster resolution of cases, improving overall team productivity.
2. Cost Reduction
Minimizes additional penalties and interest that accumulate due to delays.
Reduces labor costs associated with repetitive agency communication.
3. Improved Client Experience
Faster and more accurate resolution of notices enhances client satisfaction.
Demonstrates proactive management of tax-related issues, strengthening client trust.
4. Standardization and Accuracy
Ensures consistent calculations across analysts and teams.
Reduces risk of errors and improves compliance with agency rules.
5. Scalability and Reusability
Once validated, the calculator model can be replicated across multiple states.
Creates a reusable framework that can be adapted for future regulatory changes.
6. Strategic Advantage
Positions UKG as a forward-thinking organization leveraging automation to improve tax operations.
Enhances internal capabilities, reducing dependency on external agencies.
7. Data-Driven Insights
Testing and usage of the calculator can generate valuable data on penalty trends and resolution timelines.
8. Supports continuous improvement and informed decision-making.

"","Strategic Procurement Simulator","Advanced simulator for procurement negotiations with finance, legal, security, GTM, and layered strategies.","Simulation transforms sourcing negotiations from reactive, one-off deals into a repeatable, data-driven discipline that consistently protects value, reduces risk, and improves vendor accountability.

1. Faster Stakeholder Alignment

Traditional negotiations stall because Finance, Legal, IT, Security, and Business Owners all have different priorities.

Simulation allows each role to “play out” their objections and must-haves before the vendor is engaged, so procurement enters the room with a unified position.

2. Risk-Free Practice

Teams can practice negotiation plays (anchoring, bundling, counteroffers) in a safe environment.

This reduces the chance of making costly concessions in live negotiations.

3. Stress-Testing Strategies

Simulation lets sourcing teams test optimistic, likely, and pessimistic scenarios—e.g., what if the vendor refuses CPI caps, or insists on auto-renewals?

By preparing for different outcomes, teams avoid being caught off guard.

4. Quantifying Impact

AI simulation can generate financial models (uplift %, savings potential, TCO comparisons) tied directly to negotiation choices.

Procurement can show executives: “If we win a 3% cap instead of 7%, this saves $2.4M over 5 years.”

5. Improved Negotiation Skills

Repetition builds confidence. Teams learn how to use silence, escalation, or alternative vendors effectively by practicing role-play with simulated vendor personas (hardliner vs. collaborator vs. staller).

6. Governance & Consistency

Every negotiation can be simulated against the UKG Playbook standards—ensuring Net 60 terms, true-up/true-down flexibility, and no hidden auto-renewals are always pushed for.

This prevents drift and enforces best-in-class sourcing discipline.

7. Executive-Level Storytelling

Simulation outputs (playbooks, scenario tables, executive briefs) help Procurement translate negotiation choices into business terms executives care about: margin protection, risk mitigation, and vendor resilience.","1. From Static Playbook → Dynamic Simulation

The UKG Negotiation Playbook gives excellent rules and guardrails.

But in reality, vendors push back, stakeholders disagree, and negotiations get messy.

This GPT turns the playbook into a live, adaptive simulator, where teams can practice, test, and prepare for real-world complexity.

2. Unifies Cross-Functional Stakeholders

Procurement rarely negotiates alone — Finance wants cost savings, IT wants continuity, Security wants compliance, Legal wants exit rights.

This GPT can simulate each role’s perspective, forcing alignment before the vendor meeting.

That prevents Procurement from being undermined mid-negotiation by internal disagreement.

3. Builds Negotiation Confidence & Skill

Many buyers face seasoned vendor sales teams trained in objection handling and upsell tactics.

Simulation lets sourcing teams rehearse tough conversations and practice counters in a risk-free environment.

4. Quantifies the Business Impact of Choices

Instead of abstract “good vs. bad terms,” the GPT calculates financial impact:

3% vs. 7% uplift → multi-year savings.

Auto-renewal risk → hidden cost exposure.

Payment terms (Net 30 vs. Net 60) → cash flow value.

This ties negotiation tactics to CFO-relevant outcomes.

5. Prepares for Vendor Personas

Vendors don’t all act the same: some are collaborators, some stall, others play hardball.

This GPT simulates those personas so teams can stress-test strategies against different vendor behaviors.

6. Standardizes Best Practices Across Teams

Without simulation, each negotiator interprets the playbook differently.

With AI, every deal gets measured against UKG standards: Net 60 terms, CPI-based caps, true-up/true-down flexibility, no silent renewals.

This drives consistency, governance, and protects UKG’s long-term interests.

7. Executive-Ready Outputs

The GPT produces summaries, stress tests, and executive briefs automatically.

This means Procurement doesn’t just “negotiate better” — it communicates impact clearly to C-level stakeholders, securing buy-in.","1. Direct Cost Savings

By simulating plays and aligning stakeholders, teams push back more effectively on price uplifts, shelfware, and hidden fees.

Example: Negotiating a 3% CPI cap vs. 7% uplift can save millions over a 5-year SaaS contract.

Simulation ensures Procurement consistently lands best-in-class terms, not “good enough” renewals.

2. Margin Protection & Cash Flow

Standardizing on Net 60 terms improves working capital and free cash flow.

Avoiding auto-renewals and shelfware prevents margin erosion.

Better visibility into total cost of ownership (TCO) enables more accurate forecasting.

3. Risk Reduction

Simulated stakeholder alignment ensures compliance, security, and legal terms aren’t overlooked under vendor pressure.

Mitigates risks from vendor lock-in, silent renewals, and unfavorable SLAs.

Builds resilience through true-up/true-down rights and exit flexibility.

4. Faster, More Confident Negotiations

Teams enter vendor discussions with rehearsed counteroffers and agreed red-lines.

Cuts down negotiation cycle time by eliminating internal misalignment.

Enables earlier renewal engagement (120+ days out), preserving leverage.

5. Improved Adoption & Business Continuity

Customer Advocate and Business Owner simulations ensure user needs aren’t ignored.

Avoids sourcing “savings wins” that fail in practice due to poor adoption or feature gaps.

6. Executive Visibility & Storytelling

Outputs (executive briefs, stress tests, win-loss trackers) tie negotiation outcomes to CFO-level impact.

Procurement shifts perception from “cost-cutting” to strategic value creation and enterprise resilience.

7. Consistency & Governance at Scale

Every deal, renewal, and RFP is measured against the UKG Playbook standards.

Drives consistency across sourcing teams globally.

Ensures no negotiation leaves money on the table or exposes the business to hidden risks.

👉 In summary: The business value is millions in savings, stronger vendor accountability, better cash flow, reduced risk, and faster deal execution — all while improving cross-functional alignment and reinforcing UKG’s “Protect the House” mandate.","Predictive Modeling / Recommender","Dani Van Camp","U Krewer","Implemented","Completed","OpenAI","ChatGPT","https://chatgpt.com/g/g-68b1c20f813c8191acb41f6b8f2c4afe-strategic-procurement-simulator","8/29/2025 12:51 PM","Dani Van Camp","Not a Priority","Finance","Strategic Sourcing","343","11/19/2025 10:55 AM","Ross Sabath","False","False",""

Develop our employees into payroll-certified professionals within one year of hire.

Differentiate UKG by being the only HCM support team that can say: 100% of our frontline agents are payroll-certified.

Empower customers by embedding FPC-based knowledge checks, guides, and micro-courses into the product, helping them build their own confidence without always escalating to support.","Customer Expectations:

Customers regularly call with compliance, reporting, and payroll process questions. Many expect a certified payroll expert on the other end.

When agents cannot answer confidently, cases escalate, lengthening resolution times and lowering CSAT.

Current Gaps:

Majority of support agents are not payroll-certified, leaving us behind industry best practice.

Today, employees receive APA study books but do not sit for the exam, leading to sunk cost with no credential gained.

Competitive Landscape:

No other HCM competitor currently guarantees a certified front line. UKG could own this differentiator and position it as a market edge.

Employee Retention & Development:

Payroll professionals view FPC as a career milestone. Offering structured support shows UKG invests in their career, helping reduce attrition in a competitive job market.","Customer Impact

Higher First-Contact Resolution: Certified agents reduce rework/escalations.

Increased CSAT & Retention: Customers trust certified experts more, strengthening long-term relationships.

Employee Value

Career Path & Retention: Employees who see UKG investing in their certification are more engaged and less likely to leave (saves $10K–$20K per turnover avoided).

Stronger Brand as Employer of Choice: Payroll professionals will prefer UKG roles knowing certification support is included.

Competitive Differentiation

UKG becomes the only HCM provider that can market: “100% of our support team is FPC certified.”

Adds credibility in RFPs, prospect pitches, and customer marketing.

Financial Value

Efficiency Gains: Reduced escalations/freeing support hours (potential savings in millions annually).

"","Hyperfind Creator for Pro WFM","Automating Hyperfind Creation in Pro WFM via Customer-Provided Excel Inputs","We already have a tool that generates Hyperfinds in JSON and ZIP formats for import into UKG Pro WFM, but it currently supports a limited set of categories.

Proposal

a) Use AI to design the JSON structure from customer conditions.
Today’s program is hard-coded; when Hyperfinds require complex logical combinations (AND/OR/NOT), we must add bespoke mappings and JSON shapes, which increases complexity and maintenance. Instead, we can provide the AI with the base rules for how Hyperfinds are constructed and have it produce the correct JSON structure for each request.

b) Keep PII local and fill values post-composition.
To protect privacy, the AI will return a schema-correct JSON “skeleton” with placeholders. A local process—running within our environment—will then inject the actual customer data (e.g., employee IDs, manager EIDs) into that structure. This ensures no PII is sent to the AI while still leveraging AI for the structural logic.

Benefits

Combines the strengths of both approaches: AI handles the “thinking” and structure; our program performs deterministic validation, population, and packaging.

Reduces maintenance burden and accelerates delivery for complex Hyperfinds.

Frees consultants to focus on higher-value work (solution design, standards, QA/UAT) instead of manual build steps.

Consideration

Processing multiple Hyperfinds at once will require additional logic evaluation and compute. We can address this with local batching/queuing and by caching reference lists to keep performance predictable.","Creating Hyperfinds is a very cumbersome task. the main problem being that for most of the conditions that we need to add, the consultant has to go inside the system and then add them one by one for each Hyperfind manually. Each Hyperfind creation can take 2 mins for easy ones to 5 mins for complex ones or even more if the specified conditions by the customers are very complex. And in general a customer in new implementation can have Hyperfinds ranging from hundreds to thousands in numbers. For Example:  HCL.","This will help UKG in:

"","AI Agent for Automated Integration Monitoring -"" Project Overwatch""","Transforming Integration Monitoring with AI-Driven Automation ","Executive Summary – AI Agent for Automated Integration Monitoring in Pro WFM/UKG Dimensions

We propose developing an AI-powered monitoring agent to replace the current manual integration review process for Pro WFM/UKG Dimensions. Today, agents spend ~30 minutes per shift manually reviewing ~100 integrations across 13 clients, logging each as “C” (Completed) or “CE” (Completed with Errors). This process is time-consuming, prone to human error, and often delays client notifications and escalations.

The AI agent will:
Automatically retrieve and interpret integration statuses (C, CE, etc.) from each client’s Pro WFM Maintenance > Integrations screen.
Log results into the tracking system (Excel Spreadsheet) in real time.
For “CE” events, automatically create a Salesforce case with all relevant details.
Generate and send a client-facing email advising of the failure and the associated case number.
Maintain standardized email templates to ensure professional, consistent communication.
Provide analytics to identify recurring failure patterns for proactive resolution.
Benefits:
Save 30+ minutes per agent per day.
Reduce missed errors and escalation delays.
Deliver faster, consistent client communication.
Enable proactive identification of recurring issues.

Next Step: Pilot the AI agent with 1–2 clients to validate time savings, improve escalation speed, and measure client satisfaction impact.","The current integration monitoring process for Pro WFM/UKG Dimensions is fully manual, requiring agents to monitor 17 clients and spend an average of 20 minutes per client reviewing devices, integrations, and background processors. Each agent must be logged from the Pro WFM Maintenance > Integrations screen, with additional steps to notify clients and create Salesforce cases when errors (CE) are detected. This approach is time-consuming, error-prone, inconsistent across agents, and reactive rather than proactive, delaying corrective action and impacting client satisfaction.","Automating monitoring across 17 clients—where agents currently spend ~20 minutes per client reviewing devices, integrations, and background processors—will save significant time, eliminate repetitive manual tasks, and reduce human error in detection and escalation. This enables faster, more consistent communication, proactive issue prevention through historical trend analysis, and an improved client experience built on trust and reliability.

Each agent currently spends about 340 minutes (5.7 hours) per shift on monitoring.

"","Ready Implementation - Requirements Gathering Enhancements","Transforming Requirements Gathering in UKG Ready: Data-Driven, AI-Enabled Enhancements for Scalable Implementations","The core idea is to use AI to streamline and enrich the requirements gathering process during UKG Ready implementations—specifically within the SMB market for Payroll, HR, Benefits, and Time modules.

AI will be leveraged to:

Analyze early-stage customer data—such as pay registers, tax documents, and employee demographics—collected by Data Analysts and transformed by the Data Conversion team in Easymorph. While this data is readily available post-conversion, it is currently underutilized and not leveraged to make intelligent, data-driven inferences that could accelerate and enhance requirements gathering.

Pre-populate or intelligently suggest requirements before Solution Consultant (SC) discovery sessions, reducing manual effort and accelerating time to value.

Identify configuration patterns based on customer size, industry, or legacy system to guide SCs toward best-fit recommendations.

Auto-generate documentation or workbook inputs based on AI-driven insights, ensuring more consistent and complete discovery artifacts.

This enables a more proactive, data-informed, and scalable discovery experience, improving both delivery quality and customer outcomes without disrupting the current delivery model.","Today, Solution Consultants (SCs) often spend two to three lengthy discovery calls—each lasting 1.5 to 2 hours—just to complete requirements gathering. This is repeated for every module purchased. These sessions are heavily driven by large workbooks that must be reviewed line by line with the customer, resulting in a time-consuming and cognitively demanding experience for both parties. This method not only extends the overall project timeline but also introduces inconsistencies and inefficiencies due to the highly manual and repetitive nature of the process.

At the same time, we already collect a significant amount of valuable customer data early in the implementation lifecycle. After purchase, Data Analysts extract critical documents from the customer’s prior system, and the Data Conversion team transforms this information in Easymorph. However, none of this data is currently used to inform the SC-led discovery process. This means we're starting every implementation from a blank slate—even though we already have insights that could help define at least half of the required configurations before the SC even meets the customer.

If we can harness this early-stage data to pre-populate configurations or make intelligent inferences about customer needs, we can fundamentally shift the implementation experience. Rather than beginning with abstract workbook discussions, customers could start by reviewing an already-configured system—making their first interaction with their SC more tangible, efficient, and engaging. This would not only save hours of effort upfront but also accelerate time to value and reinforce UKG’s commitment to delivering smarter, more streamlined implementations.","Business Value – So, What Are the Anticipated Benefits to UKG?
This initiative delivers tangible, cross-functional benefits across Implementation Services, customer experience, and broader strategic alignment with UKG’s AI roadmap.

1. Faster, More Scalable Implementations
By using AI to extract insights from early-stage data and pre-inform requirements gathering, we can reduce time spent in manual discovery and accelerate configuration readiness. This supports shorter project timelines, improved resource utilization, and greater scalability—particularly critical for the high-volume SMB segment.

2. Improved Customer Experience from Day One
Instead of walking through dense, unfamiliar workbooks, customers would begin their journey with a pre-configured platform tailored to their business. This sets a stronger first impression, increases engagement, and enhances clarity during decision-making. A more interactive and visual onboarding experience also reduces fatigue and confusion in early-stage calls.

3. Higher Quality and Consistency of Deliverables
AI-informed requirements gathering helps reduce gaps, missed edge cases, and inconsistencies across implementations. This results in better-aligned configurations, fewer change orders, and less rework—leading to smoother deployments and better outcomes for both customers and consultants.

4. Optimization of Internal Resources
By front-loading intelligent automation, we reduce the number and length of SC-led discovery sessions. This frees up high-skill consultants to handle more projects, invest time in complex solutioning, or support high-value strategic accounts—maximizing both productivity and margin.

5. Strategic Differentiation & AI Adoption
This effort visibly extends UKG’s AI narrative beyond products into services delivery.

"","OE SR RESOURCING","AI-powered consultant resourcing streamlines Open Enrollment staffing, saving time and ensuring precision.","Every year, the Open Enrollment (OE) season demands the manual assignment of up to 1,200 projects to consultants, based on a complex matrix of criteria including customer type, project complexity, system used, and historical assignments. This process is not only time-consuming but also susceptible to inconsistency, bias, and consultant overload—especially under tight OE timelines. To solve this, a custom GPT-based solution was developed to automate consultant assignments using live Smartsheet data. This tool applies pre-defined logic to match consultants with the right experience and qualifications to projects, while accounting for exceptions such as Ben Hub and Elevate 300 clients. By programmatically enforcing rules and removing subjectivity, it delivers rapid, fair, and repeatable staffing decisions.

The goal is to significantly reduce the administrative burden on managers during OE planning, while improving staffing accuracy, equity, and transparency. Automating this workflow with GPT empowers the consulting team to focus on execution rather than resource juggling, and allows managers to validate decisions quickly. With future integration into Smartsheet, this AI-driven approach is designed to be scalable, audit-friendly, and easy to deploy across future OE seasons.","High Volume, High Stakes: The OE season involves assigning up to 1,200 projects each year, a scale that demands efficiency and precision.

Manual Effort is Unsustainable: Current assignments are manually executed, requiring significant time from managers to assess multiple variables per project (complexity, prior consultant, system type, etc.).

Inconsistencies and Bottlenecks: Human decision-making introduces variability, unintentional bias, and the risk of delays during peak planning windows.

Bias Mitigation: A rules-based GPT system applies consistent logic, removing subjective decisions and ensuring equity in consultant assignments.

Scalability and Future-readiness: With plans to integrate with Smartsheet, this solution is designed to scale automatically with future OE cycles, improving transparency and auditability.","Time Savings: Automating project assignments can eliminate dozens of manual hours, freeing up manager capacity during the busiest time of year.

Improved Accuracy: GPT logic ensures consultants are matched to projects based on skills, experience, and client needs, reducing mismatches and escalations.

Equitable Assignments: By removing human bias, the tool supports fairer and more transparent staffing decisions, aligning with UKG’s values.

Scalability: The model supports growth, allowing UKG to efficiently manage more clients and consultants without increasing manual workload.

Operational Resilience: Reduces reliance on institutional knowledge and makes the resourcing process repeatable, auditable, and easier to onboard new managers.

Cross-Unit Applicability: The logic is adaptable and can be applied to other UKG business units managing high volumes of service requests—extending value beyond Open Enrollment.","Predictive Modeling / Recommender","Eric Grinberg","Project & Program Manager,U Krewer,People Leaders","Idea","Not Started","OpenAI","ChatGPT","https://chatgpt.com/g/g-688791f3d8d48191bc34181b51f419a0-open-enrollment-resourcing","8/7/2025 5:33 PM","Eric Grinberg","","","","300","10/8/2025 9:26 AM","Lakshmi Sathyavageeswaran","False","False",""

","The Payroll Export Reconciliation (also known as a parallel test) is a critical step in any UKG implementation. It ensures that the payroll output from UKG PRO Workforce Management (WFM) aligns with legacy payroll systems prior to go-live. Today, this reconciliation process is highly manual, time-consuming, and error-prone. It requires significant SME involvement and spreadsheet manipulation to identify pay mismatches across systems.
This proposal recommends launching an AI-enabled proof-of-concept to automate the reconciliation process. By using AI/ML to extract, compare, and surface payroll discrepancies, UKG Implementation Services can deliver faster, more accurate reconciliations, reduce SME fatigue, and position UKG as an innovative implementation leader.","Problem Statement
Payroll reconciliation requires comparing complex, large-volume payroll export files from both the legacy system and UKG PRO WFM. The goal is to ensure parity in paid hours, including key pay elements such as regular, overtime, differentials, and accruals. This process involves:
•	Exporting and standardizing payroll output from both systems.
•	Matching employee records.
•	Using Excel pivot tables to identify differences in pay codes, hours, or earnings.
•	Validating against timekeeping, accrual, and cross-reference tables.
Current Challenges
1.	Manual File Handling
o	Implementation consultants must manually extract and reformat CSV or XLS payroll exports from legacy and UKG systems.
o	This is labor-intensive, error-prone, and not scalable across customers.
2.	Complex Cross-System Logic
o	Mapping legacy pay elements to UKG pay codes is inconsistent across customers and often undocumented.
o	Requires tribal knowledge of both systems and pay policy interpretation.
3.	Data Volume
o	Even a single pay period for a mid-sized customer can include thousands of lines of data.
o	Spreadsheets are large, with layered logic and formulas that are hard to maintain.
4.	Inconsistent Analysis
o	Analysts must look for mismatches in hours, dollars, and earnings manually.
o	Edge cases and timing differences (e.g., accrual lag, retro pay) are easy to miss.
5.	Resource Intensive
o	Requires trained consultants with access to both systems and deep knowledge of customer pay policies.
o	Diverts SME time away from higher-value tasks.

Between the extensive research and case handling effort, we incur a high operational cost to manage the consequences of upstream defects.  While we should mitigate the causes for notices to begin with, some volume is unavoidable or expected.  Today, we are not capturing acknowledgement and approval for future punitive damages from either UKG or it's customers when defects occur.  Therefore, we must engage in heavy research 6-9-12 months after the defect to 1) obtain documented evidence that identifies cause and responsible party, and 2) explain the issue to the responsible party in such a way that they agree to incur the punitive costs.  We could virutally eliminate the need for this manual research, by 1) capturing acknowledgement at the time of defect from the responsible party and save it to a database 2) when a notice comes in, we can match it to the event and citing the original acknowledgement, automatically process a tax notice case (E2E) to eliminate operational cost + UKG / Customer exposure to additional punitive damages by delaying resolution.  UKG would then only manage the exceptions (no match, no acknowledgement, unknown origin event).","130k tax notice cases last year, averaging 38 days to resolve.

"","AI-Driven Scenario Modeling for Emotionally Intelligent Client Interactions","Leveraging AI to simulate interaction scenarios and provide real-time guidance based on client personality data, enabling emotionally intelligent communication strategies that improve outcomes, build trust, and prevent conflict.","In client-facing roles, emotional intelligence and personalized communication are critical for building strong relationships, navigating challenging conversations, and ensuring client satisfaction. However, not all employees have the tools or insights to dynamically adapt their communication style based on a client’s personality profile—especially in high-stakes or emotionally charged situations.

This use case introduces a solution where AI processes structured personality data (e.g., DISC, Big Five, MBTI) to generate a range of hypothetical interaction scenarios—both positive and negative. It then provides contextual recommendations tailored to each client’s unique psychological profile, helping UKrewers to respond constructively during critical moments.

The opportunity lies in:

Proactively mitigating tension by recognizing early signals of emotional escalation and offering de-escalation tactics.

Improving relationship quality by customizing tone, approach, and messaging for each client.

Enhancing employee preparedness by simulating ""what-if"" interactions, increasing confidence and adaptability.

Reducing churn and conflict by making conversations more empathetic and effective, especially when stakes are high.

This capability could be particularly impactful in industries like sales, customer success, support, consulting, and HR—anywhere strong interpersonal communication is tied to business outcomes.","Personality-Based Insights Drive Results: Studies show that tailoring communication to personality types can increase persuasion, satisfaction, and trust in professional contexts.

Emotional Intelligence is a Top Driver of Performance: According to TalentSmart, 90% of top performers have high emotional intelligence (EQ), and employees with high EQ outperform peers by up to 20% in customer-facing roles.

AI in Coaching and Behavioral Modeling is Effective: Companies like IBM, Salesforce, and BetterUp have implemented AI to support employee communication and coaching—resulting in measurable improvements in employee performance, retention, and client satisfaction.

Scenario Planning Reduces Communication Errors: Role-playing and scenario simulation—when supported by AI—reduces the likelihood of conflict or client dissatisfaction by enabling preemptive preparation.

Market Adoption Trends: The rise of AI-powered behavioral intelligence tools (e.g., Crystal, Humantic AI, Receptiviti) in sales and customer success teams points to a clear demand for scalable, personality-driven communication aids.","Implementing this AI-driven scenario modeling and recommendation system based on client personality profiles delivers significant business benefits:

1. Improved Client Outcomes
Higher client satisfaction scores due to more personalized and empathetic communication.

Reduced conflict and escalations in high-stress interactions.

Stronger long-term client relationships and improved retention.

2. Employee Enablement & Confidence

Today, this often requires custom integrations that are time-consuming, brittle, or raise security concerns. MCP provides a standardized, governed protocol that allows customers to connect UKG data to their AI models seamlessly — with built-in access controls, auditing, and context injection. This unlocks customer innovation while protecting data, reducing integration cost, and accelerating AI adoption across the UKG ecosystem.","Customers are rapidly adopting AI to enhance decision-making, automate tasks, and personalize employee experiences. However, securely integrating UKG data into their AI workflows is challenging today due to lack of standard interfaces, inconsistent context availability, and concerns around compliance and data governance. Without a secure and scalable method like MCP, customers face delays, risks, and high integration costs — limiting AI adoption and reducing UKG’s role in their broader digital strategy.","MCP positions UKG as a trusted AI partner by enabling safe, governed, and scalable access to contextual data across customer-owned AI workflows. This drives higher product stickiness, faster customer innovation, and stronger competitive differentiation.

Adherence to release principles, readiness field governance in Jira, and proactive test/status reporting is critical for delivering high-quality, timely features while minimizing customer disruption.

ReleaseGPT leverages internal artifacts and AI to act as a governance advisor and planning assistant for TPMs, RMs, PMs, and engineering teams. It answers detailed questions on:
Release schedules and milestone timelines, Governance processes like exceptions and PKTs, Jira field hygiene and ownership across pillars, Toggle management and testing coordination, Readiness gaps using Pro Suite audit and status data.
This use case significantly reduces manual coordination, ensures compliance with established practices (as outlined in the Release Principles), and allows teams to plan with confidence and speed.","We found operational challenges by collecting user feedback from 20+ stakeholder interviews across EPIC roles (Product, TPM, Engineering, RMs, Enablement). We identified these core challenges throughout the release process:

Release Calendar Management: Current UI is overwhelming and lacks clear integration of key milestones such as branch lock (HCM), code freeze (WFM), PKT dates, and tenant-specific deployment timelines.

Process Complexity: Difficulty understanding and applying fixed vs. release version, toggle strategies, and differences across Service, Minor, and Major release constraints.

Awareness Gaps: Teams are often unaware of process changes, readiness gaps, or org-specific requirements; VAS enablement and WoW outcomes lack integration.

Governance Compliance: Difficulty tracking violations of Release Principles, managing Jira field hygiene, and ensuring toggles/test data are complete.

","ReleaseGPT delivers significant business value to UKG by increasing efficiency, governance, and transparency across the product release lifecycle. It reduces manual effort spent navigating SharePoint, Confluence, Jira, and various dashboards by providing instant, accurate answers to common questions about release schedules, PKT status, toggle configurations, and Jira field compliance. This automation frees up valuable time for TPMs, RMs, and PMs while minimizing the risk of non-compliant or delayed deployments. By proactively flagging governance issues—such as missing readiness fields or incorrect fix/release versions—ReleaseGPT enforces alignment with UKG’s Release Principles. It enhances communication between engineering, product, and enablement teams by resolving repetitive process inquiries and making changes or exception paths easier to understand and act upon. Ultimately, ReleaseGPT streamlines coordination, reduces escalations, and supports faster, higher-quality releases—ensuring UKG can scale its product delivery without sacrificing compliance or customer experience.","Data Extraction","Brianna Roberts","Product Management & Business Analysis,Project & Program Manager,Software Engineering & UI/UX","Idea","Not Started","UKG","GPT Hub, Gen AI Assistant","https://ukginc-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/srivya_sabbella_ukg_com/EZZEITOopJdFn4t-1fiB3XEBYTazKQcnZtqyJIoIdOdBAg?e=2jdcXk","7/15/2025 4:27 PM","Srivya Sabbella","","","","213","10/8/2025 9:26 AM","Lakshmi Sathyavageeswaran","False","False",""

"","Automated Candidate Assessment Score Extraction and Tracking","Streamline the engineering hiring process by auto-extracting HackerRank scores from outlook emails and updating candidate records in real-time on our excel spreadsheet ","As a Talent Acquisition Partner supporting the Engineering group at UKG, managing HackerRank assessments is a manual and repetitive task. Each candidate is first sent an assessment, followed by a personal email explaining the requirement. Once the assessment is completed, their scores—received via Outlook—must be manually reviewed and added to a master Excel tracker.

This process is time-consuming and prone to human error. The opportunity is to use AI-powered automation to:

Automatically detect and extract HackerRank scores from Outlook emails.

Parse the relevant candidate information and scores using natural language processing (NLP).

Populate an Excel or Google Sheet in real time with the extracted results.

Optionally, trigger a follow-up email or status update within your ATS based on pass/fail outcomes.

By automating this workflow, UKG can eliminate unnecessary administrative overhead, reduce errors, and improve the candidate experience by speeding up the hiring process.","We have tons of Engineering reqs - it is so time-consuming doing this. ","Efficiency: Saves recruiters time by eliminating manual score tracking and email tasks.

"","Detect Mobile App bad state","Identify and Resolve bad state scenarios within the App","We have seen in the past how difficult it is to fix some bad state scenarios in the mobile app like blank white screen. Since our app is a hybrid one, there's always a case where the web view didn't load when the app transitions from background. This particular white screen issue is completely sporadic and despite adding many logs, we have seen it coming back time and again. 


I competed a P.O.C leveraging a native iOS model (ImageClassifier), and trained it with 2 sets of data -  NormalScreen and WhiteScreen. 


I imported that model into our app, and using iOS CoreML framework, I was able to successfully find the white screen cases. 
As you see in the confluence page link , there are 2 videos- 

https://engconf.int.kronos.com/spaces/UKGSE/pages/961498498/Spike+-+AI+-+Create+ML+-+ImageClassifier

In the first video, I deliberately set a white screen issue when the app transforms from the background to foreground, and the model was able to predict it and take the user back to the login screen. 

Second video shows how simple all these are to have it in our app. 

Since all these are native, latency should not be of concern, and it can work offline too. Being on device model protects privacy and guards from any other security concerns.
White screen issue is just one of the many bad state that our app can get into. 

We can train our model to detect following use case scenarios - 

    1) Continuous spinner UI display
    2) Home page loading issue 
    3) Menu items not showing as expected
    4) Shortcuts not being available on the dashboard



","Issues like blank white screen and persistent spinner display have been a constant problem, and we have recevied many production support tickets. 
This along with other concerns regarding Dashboard Shortcuts needs to be addressed ","We will be able to identify when the app gets into a bad state, and act on it accordingly. All issues will hook into our alert monitoring system and notify the dev team. We don't have to wait for a prod support call. 

Based on the issue, we can provide automated solutions. For instance, if the app gets into a blank white screen mode when it gets transitioned from background state, we can trigger a sign out call, and put the app back to the very first page.

"","Adaptive Interview Question Generator for Talent Screening","Boost hiring efficiency with an AI assistant that crafts role- and resume-specific screening questions.","Certainly! Here's a **7–8 line description** that clearly outlines the idea, the role of AI, and the business value:

---

This AI-powered tool revolutionizes the early stages of recruitment by automatically generating tailored screening questions for each job opportunity. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs), the system analyzes job descriptions and candidate resumes to craft contextually relevant and role-specific questions. It ensures that each candidate is evaluated based on the most pertinent criteria, aligned with both the job’s requirements and their unique experience.

AI dynamically adapts questions in real time, accounting for resume nuances such as skills, achievements, and career progression. This not only saves recruiters time but also standardizes and elevates the screening process, reducing bias and improving candidate engagement. The solution can be integrated with applicant tracking systems (ATS) or used as a standalone module in digital hiring workflows. Ultimately, it enhances efficiency, ensures better fit assessment, and supports smarter hiring decisions.
","Great question. Here's a clear explanation of **why this AI-powered screening tool is needed**, focusing on business pain points and value:

---

### ❓ **Why It’s Needed**

1. Manual Screening Is Time-Consuming and Inconsistent
   Recruiters often spend hours crafting screening questions and manually reviewing resumes—an inefficient, repetitive process prone to oversight and inconsistency.

2. Generic Questions Miss Candidate Nuances
   Static, one-size-fits-all screening questions don’t reflect the specific requirements of a role or the unique experience of a candidate, leading to missed opportunities or poor hiring matches.

3. Increasing Volume of Applications
   With a surge in job applications driven by digital platforms, it's difficult to maintain quality and speed in initial candidate assessments without automation.

4. Bias and Subjectivity in Early Filtering
   Human-generated questions can inadvertently introduce bias. AI can help create more consistent and equitable evaluation criteria.

5. Need for Personalization at Scale
   Personalizing the interview process improves candidate experience and employer branding—AI enables this personalization at scale without increasing recruiter workload.

6. Improved Hiring Outcomes
   By aligning questions directly with job descriptions and resumes, the tool helps identify top-fit candidates faster, improving time-to-hire and quality-of-hire metrics.

"","Supplier Lens - A Contract Intelligence Assistanct","Supplier Lens: Contract Intelligence at Speed and Scale","UKG manages hundreds of suppliers, contracts, audits, and renewal timelines across a sprawling enterprise. But validating key terms, identifying risks, and ensuring data consistency across contracts, spend reports, and supplier profiles is still manual, fragmented, and slow.
This GPT unlocks a smarter path forward. Supplier Lens automates contract intelligence, surfacing structured supplier profiles, risk indicators, and audit-readiness insights in real time — simply by uploading procurement documents and asking natural questions.

This is a more advance version of the Procurement AI tool launched last year in a different platform.","✅ Volume of Data: Legal and sourcing teams are buried under hundreds of supplier documents, many poorly tagged or inconsistent.

✅ Manual Risk Checks: Validating auto-renewals, payment terms, and true-ups is labor-intensive and error-prone.

✅ Missed Renewal Triggers: Gaps in metadata and profile alignment lead to missed escalations or manual renewals without full risk clarity.

✅ Audit Pressure: Inconsistent tracking of audit clauses, pricing caps, or exclusivity terms creates compliance vulnerabilities.

✅ Growing Complexity: Strategic relationships, pricing arrangements, and customer-supplier overlaps demand a smarter lens.

This GPT turns a pain point into a powerhouse — delivering instant clarity across fragmented documents

GPT Will Be Used For
Supplier Lens acts as a conversational analyst for procurement, legal, and sourcing teams. It will be used to:

Extract key terms from unstructured and structured files — contracts, SOWs, audit logs, spend summaries, and supplier profiles.

Build standardized Supplier Profiles including:

Contract status, dates, auto-renewal terms

Payment terms, true-up clauses, audit rights

Spend and committed values

Risk flags for missing or conflicting info

Cross-reference data across multiple sources (contract > profile > spend) to fill in gaps or expose discrepancies.

Identify red/yellow/green flags for missing fields, outdated profiles, or contradictions.

Support proactive renewals and audits by generating ready-to-export profiles and dashboards.

Example prompts:

“Build a profile for Vendor X.”
“What are the risks in this MSA?”
“Which contracts auto-renew in Q4?”
“Highlight suppliers with missing audit rights.”
","🚀 Speed & Efficiency
Reduces contract review cycles from hours to minutes.

Enables analysts to focus on negotiation, not metadata extraction.

🧠 Intelligence & Risk Mitigation
Flags outdated, incomplete, or conflicting supplier data.

Surfaces contract-critical terms (e.g., auto-renewal or true-ups) often missed in manual review.

📈 Executive Visibility
Structured outputs can feed dashboards, audit logs, or renewal planning reports.

Supports strategic sourcing by spotlighting key vendors and risks.

🔄 Cross-File Consistency
Ensures that contracts, profiles, and spend data align — or clearly show where they don’t.

Reinforces audit-readiness with explainable logic and document trail traceability.

🔒 Compliance & Governance
Red/yellow/green flag logic builds accountability and supports escalations.

Prioritizes the most authoritative source when conflicts arise.

"","Signature Authority Lookup","Fast. Accurate. Accountable: UKG’s Signature Authority GPT Unlocks Approval Clarity in Seconds.","In an enterprise as complex as UKG, navigating who can authorize what—especially for contracts and financial commitments—is a tedious and error-prone task. Manual lookups, outdated spreadsheets, and vague policies create bottlenecks and compliance risks.
The Signature Authority Lookup GPT automates and simplifies this process. It instantly determines the appropriate approval authority based on UKG’s internal signature thresholds and departmental hierarchy. It ensures every decision is backed by policy logic, reducing time-to-approval and improving governance.","A pain point for teams. 
Fragmentation: Signature policies are buried in PDFs or tribal knowledge.

Inefficiency: Routine inquiries waste leadership time or slow down procurement and contract flows.

Risk: Unauthorized approvals introduce audit and compliance risks.

Scale: With multiple departments and evolving hierarchies, maintaining manual accuracy is unrealistic.

Demand: Regular escalation and clarification requests already come through to Procurement—this GPT formalizes and scales what’s already being done ad hoc.

 What This GPT Will Be Used For
This GPT serves as a real-time internal assistant that:

Determines who has authority to approve a given dollar amount in a specific department.

Provides justification for required title levels.

Identifies the current leader who meets both the title and departmental criteria.

Enforces no-guessing policies by only returning results found in the verified org hierarchy.

Automatically escalates unresolved queries to designated owners (Dani Van Camp → Renato Marchinares).

Example queries include:

“Who can approve a $75K contract in Finance?”

“Why does a $300,000 Legal deal need VP signoff?”
.","Operational Efficiency
Reduces back-and-forth with legal, procurement, and finance on approval clarity.

Speeds up deal processing and project kickoffs.

✅ Compliance & Governance
Ensures policies are consistently applied across departments.

Reduces audit risk by preventing unapproved signatures.

✅ Scalability
Built to evolve with UKG’s organizational structure—just update the org file.

Handles new departments, roles, and structures with minimal effort.

✅ Time Savings
Instantly answers what used to be slow, manual questions.

Frees up legal, sourcing, and finance leads for higher-value work.

✅ Executive Confidence
Empowers leaders with immediate clarity and defensible logic behind signatory requirements.","Conversational AI","Dani Van Camp","Business Operations, Delivery & Enablement,Customer Success & Services","Diagnose","Help Needed","Open AI","ChatGPT","https://chatgpt.com/g/g-686d3a1b3b708191adf97d44b18f02f0-signature-authority-lookup","7/11/2025 12:09 PM","Dani Van Camp","","Finance","Strategic Sourcing","184","11/19/2025 10:55 AM","Ross Sabath","False","False",""
"","From User Story to Git Commit: Closing the Loop with AI","AI-Powered Agents Deliver Real-Time Insight into What We Build and Why","We’re initiating a phased strategy to modernize how BSAs, developers, and QAs collaborate — reducing manual documentation and increasing traceability through AI integration.

Phase One (POC):
We’re piloting Modern Requirements, an AI-powered tool integrated with Azure DevOps. It enables BSAs to work directly in ADO, where documentation (BRDs, FDDs, TDDs) is automatically updated and maintained — eliminating redundant effort.

End-to-End Vision:
Unified Documentation
Living documents in Azure DevOps replace static Word files, ensuring real-time updates across teams.

Traceable Design & Code Decisions
Business user stories are directly linked to design and development decisions. AI agents will surface why specific designs or code paths were chosen — factoring in current architecture and existing codebases.

Code Visibility
GitHub pull requests are automatically linked to ADO work items, providing full traceability from requirement to implementation.

Automated QA
Test scripts are generated via Modern Requirements CoPilot, accelerating validation and reducing manual QA effort.

AI-Powered Knowledge Retrieval
Long-term, personal AI agents will retrieve historical context on how and why systems were built — improving onboarding, audits, and change impact analysis.

This initiative builds on our strong Microsoft ecosystem (Azure DevOps, GitHub, Office 365) and positions us to scale AI-driven productivity across the SDLC.","Outdated Documentation Creates Risk
Many BRDs, FDDs, and TDDs live in SharePoint and are no longer current. As systems evolve, these static documents fall out of sync — leading to confusion, rework, and missed requirements.

Organizational Change Has Accelerated
Teams have restructured, roles have shifted, and responsibilities have changed. Without a centralized, living source of truth, critical knowledge is lost or siloed.

Loss of Institutional Knowledge
As experienced team members leave, so does the context behind design and code decisions. New team members struggle to understand why something was built a certain way — slowing onboarding and increasing the risk of misaligned changes.

Manual Processes Are Inefficient
BSAs and developers spend significant time duplicating effort across Word, Excel, Azure DevOps, and GitHub. This fragmentation leads to version control issues and inconsistent documentation.

AI Can Bridge the Gaps
Tools like Modern Requirements and CoPilot for DevOps can:

Maintain living documents directly in Azure DevOps
Link business stories to design/code decisions
Surface historical rationale and related code
Auto-generate test scripts for QA

We’re Positioned to Move Fast
Our existing Microsoft ecosystem (Azure DevOps, GitHub, Office 365) gives us a strong foundation to scale AI-driven automation with minimal disruption.","Increased Delivery Speed
Automating documentation and traceability reduces manual effort, enabling faster handoffs between BSAs, developers, and QAs — accelerating time-to-market for new features.

Improved Quality and Consistency
Living documents and AI-generated test scripts reduce human error, ensure alignment across teams, and improve the overall quality of deliverables.

Enhanced Traceability and Compliance
Full visibility from user story to code and test case supports better audit readiness, change impact analysis, and regulatory compliance.

Reduced Knowledge Loss
AI agents preserve institutional knowledge by capturing the why behind design and code decisions — critical in a dynamic environment with team restructuring and turnover.

Lower Operational Costs
By reducing rework, manual documentation, and onboarding time, UKG can reallocate resources to higher-value activities and innovation.

Strategic Use of Existing Investments
This initiative builds on UKG’s existing Microsoft ecosystem (Azure DevOps, GitHub, Office 365), maximizing ROI without requiring new platforms.

"","Accelerating SQL Development with Schema-Aware AI in SSMS","AI-Augmented Data Access: Enabling Faster, Safer, and Smarter SQL Workflows","We are exploring the use of schema-aware AI, such as Copilot for SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), to enhance how engineers and analysts interact with our SQL databases. These tools go beyond traditional AI assistants by understanding the actual structure of our databases—tables, relationships, column names, and constraints—allowing them to generate accurate, context-aware queries.

This capability significantly reduces time spent writing and debugging SQL by suggesting correct syntax, joins, and filters based on the real schema. It also lowers the barrier for less-experienced users to access data safely and correctly, reducing reliance on senior engineers or DBAs for routine reporting and exploration.

By using schema-aware AI, we improve developer productivity, reduce query errors, increase access to data insights, and improve consistency in how data is queried and understood across teams. This unlocks faster decision-making, better collaboration between technical and business users, and more confident use of our enterprise data assets.

","Writing efficient, accurate SQL queries requires deep knowledge of database structure, relationships, naming conventions, and business rules. In large or complex environments, this creates several challenges:

High dependency on subject matter experts (e.g., DBAs or senior developers) to assist with query design, schema navigation, and performance tuning

Frequent trial-and-error when writing queries due to unfamiliar schemas, leading to lost time and frustration

Risk of data quality issues caused by incorrect joins, filters, or assumptions about table relationships

Bottlenecks in analytics and reporting, especially for teams that need data access but lack strong SQL skills

Inconsistent query patterns and logic across teams, making it harder to maintain or validate results

Traditional AI tools can help with generic SQL generation but often fail in environments where schema context is critical—which is almost always the case in enterprise systems.

Schema-aware AI (like Copilot for SSMS) directly addresses this gap by understanding the actual structure of the database in real time. It enables:

Smarter, more accurate query generation

Real-time suggestions that reflect true table relationships and naming conventions

Easier onboarding for new engineers or analysts

Safer, faster access to critical data

A shift from manual effort to guided, intelligent workflows

In short, schema-aware AI can transform how we interact with our data—improving speed, trust, and accessibility across both technical and non-technical teams.","Faster query development by eliminating guesswork around table structures and relationships

Reduced dependency on senior engineers and DBAs for routine data access and reporting

Lower risk of data errors due to AI-generated queries that align with the actual schema

Increased self-service capabilities for analysts and other non-expert users

Shorter onboarding time for new team members who need to work with SQL

More consistent, maintainable SQL across teams and projects

Better utilization of data assets for decision-making, powered by quicker access to accurate insights

"","Credit & Concession Request Intake Form - Root Cause AI Assistant","Improve customer billing escalation process through proper routing","We recently went live with our new Credit & Concession Request (CCR) intake form in Salesforce. This form is used for teams across UKG to submit various types of customer billing escalations, inquiries, credit requests, contract change requests, and termination requests. The routing for these requests is based on the primary, secondary, and tertiary root causes selected by the requestor. A major pain point for the teams responsible for reviewing and responding to these requests is improper routing based on the root causes selected. The root cause options are not always the most intuitive and accuracy is highly dependent on the requestor's level of expertise. The majority of the time, routing should really be based on the type of fee involved in the request (i.e. PEPM subscription fee minimums or overages, Service Requests, Launch Fees, Forms & Print Services, Hardware, etc.), though there are some exceptions to this. We would see major improvements in efficiency and effectiveness if we could ensure requests are routed to the appropriate team upon submission, as opposed to sitting in one backlog just to be re-routed and sitting in another backlog. AI could be utilized to ask some clarifying questions of the user, potentially pull invoice line details to understand the type of fee associated with the request, and help guide the user on which root causes to select to ensure appropriate routing. Additionally, AI could help answering some of the more basic questions or guide the requestor on how they can find the answer themselves.","see above","Increased customer satisfaction with reduced time to respond; reduced administrative effort on the resources involved in reviewing these requests.","Conversational AI","Danielle Santiago","Business Operations, Delivery & Enablement,Privacy, Regulatory & Compliance,Customer Success & Services,Product Management & Business Analysis,U Krewer,Sales / Marketing Agents","Implemented","Completed","Open AI","ChatGPT","/teams/ConcessionCreditRequestManagementResourceSite","7/9/2025 5:21 PM","Mary Lawson","","Finance","Billing Operations","120","11/5/2025 10:25 AM","Brita McGrath","False","False",""
